Write a detailed, exam-focused lesson (400–600 words). Structure it clearly:

**Overview**
One paragraph introducing the concept.

**Key Concepts**
- **Term 1:** Definition and why it matters
- **Term 2:** Definition and why it matters
(at least 3–5 key terms with bold labels)

**How It Works**
Step-by-step explanation with examples. For maths: show worked examples with numbers. For science: explain the mechanism. For English: show a model paragraph. For history/geography: give real-world context and dates.
